# Сool Screen Filter Xiaomi Redmi Note 14 PRO
The Xiaomi Redmi Note 14 Pro has an AMOLED screen with color temperature adjustment. However, this adjustment is limited, and the screen remains yellowish. This app uses a filter over the screen to enhance the cool temperature while trying not to greatly affect the shadows. For Android 15/HyperOs 2.0.211.0. But it may work on other versions as well. Before use, enable the “Bright colors” color scheme in your phone settings and move the temperature ring towards the cold side.
